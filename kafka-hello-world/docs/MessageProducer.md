### Code Breakdown
#### Dependency Injection with `@Autowired`
```java
    @Autowired
    private KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate;
```
- The `KafkaTemplate` is the high-level abstraction that allows sending messages to Kafka topics. 
- This is the object that we configure in the `ProducerConfig` class and inject into the `MessageProducer` class using the `@Autowired` annotation.
- The generic types `<String, String>` indicate that both the keys and values of the messages being sent are strings.

#### Sending Messages
```java
    public void sendMessage(String topic, String message) {
```
- This line defines a public method named `sendMessage` that takes two parameters: `topic` (the Kafka topic to which the message will be sent) and `message` (the message payload).

```java
        kafkaTemplate.send(topic, message);
```
- Inside the `sendMessage` method, the `send` method of the `kafkaTemplate` instance is called.
- This method takes the `topic` and `message` parameters and sends the message to the specified Kafka topic.
- The `send` operation is non-blocking in nature, meaning that it will return immediately and not wait for the message to be acknowledged by the Kafka broker. 

### Summary
In summary, the `MessageProducer` class is a simple service responsible for sending messages to specified Kafka topics. 
It uses dependency injection to get a `KafkaTemplate` instance, which it leverages to send messages quickly and efficiently.
