### Code Breakdown

#### Kafka Listener Annotation
```java
    @KafkaListener(topics = "my-topic", groupId = "my-group-id")
```
- The `@KafkaListener` annotation is a Spring annotation used to indicate that the method it annotates should listen for messages from a Kafka topic.
- **`topics = "my-topic"`**: This specifies the name of the Kafka topic that the listener will subscribe to. In this case, it is set to "my-topic". Whenever a new message is published to "my-topic", this listener will be triggered.
- **`groupId = "my-group-id"`**: This specifies the consumer group ID for this listener. Kafka uses consumer groups to manage and distribute message consumption. All consumers that have the same group ID will share the responsibility of consuming messages from the specified topic, allowing for load balancing. 
Each message will be processed by only one consumer within the group.

#### Listening Method
```java
    public void listen(String message) {
        System.out.println("Received message: " + message);
    }
```
- This method, named `listen`, takes a single parameter of type `String` called `message`. This parameter will hold the content of the message received from the Kafka topic.
- Within the method, there is a single `System.out.println` statement that outputs the received message to the console. This is a simple way to demonstrate that the consumer has successfully received the message. You could replace this line with more sophisticated processing logic as needed.

### Summary
In summary, the `MessageConsumer` class is designed to handle incoming messages from a specific Kafka topic ("my-topic"). When a message is published to this topic, the method annotated with `@KafkaListener` (in this case, the `listen` method) is triggered, and the contents of the message are printed to the console.
